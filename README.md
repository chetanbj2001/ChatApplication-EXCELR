# ChatApplication-EXCELR
# Chat App
This is a versatile chat application built with React, React Router DOM, Socket.IO, and Express for real-time communication between clients and agents. The application supports the concept of waiting rooms, allowing multiple clients to connect simultaneously. If a client disconnects, another client can seamlessly join the chat room.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Server Dependencies

The server uses the following dependencies:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - A web application framework for Node.js.
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) - Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
- [CORS](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) - Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - A tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

The client uses the following dependencies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) - Declarative routing for React.js applications.
- [Socket.IO Client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/) - Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
